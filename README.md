# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Learning
Learning and implementing RISC-V SoC concepts through weekly tasks, simulations, and tapeout preparation
This repository documents my journey through the RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program, covering everything from the basics of RISC-V architecture to SoC design, simulation, and final tapeout preparation.

Each weekâ€™s tasks include:

Theory + Practical Implementation of RISC-V concepts

Simulation and Testing using open-source EDA tools

Block Diagrams, Results, and Analysis for better understanding

Automated Workflows for build, test, and verification


The goal is to build a well-structured, reproducible, and professional learning repository for future reference and for others interested in RISC-V SoC design.
